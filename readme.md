# terrain_d
#### Terrain demo that utilizes a quad tree for LOD. OpenGL + GLUT is used for rendering.

### Build notes

*Windows*

Obtain glut from http://user.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html
Place glut32.dll in c:\windows\syswow64 (if on x64 windows)
Place header and lib in a common location. I used c:\dev\glut\include and c:\dev\glut\lib
